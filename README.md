# Smart-Room-Control-Node
A smart IoT-based room monitoring system that reads temperature, humidity, motion, and battery status, then makes automatic decisions to control actuators such as fans, dehumidifiers, lights, and alarms. The project simulates real sensor behavior using Python conditionals and prints clear command outputs that represent actual IoT device actions.
